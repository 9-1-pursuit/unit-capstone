## Individual Project Code Wars

Your goal will be to accumulate at certain number of points points on code wars during this module. The more points you acquire the more likely you are to pass a technical interview.

[Ranking system](https://docs.codewars.com/gamification/ranks/)

You will be tracked with [Pursuit's Code Wars Tracker](https://codewars-tracker-fe.herokuapp.com)
