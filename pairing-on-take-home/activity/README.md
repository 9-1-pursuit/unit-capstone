# Paring on a Take Home Activity

You will be paired with another fellow. Your goal will be to add a new feature to each of your take home challenges.

You will divide half the time working on your take home challenge as the driver, and your partner as the observer.

Halfway through, you will stop and switch projects and roles. It doesn't matter if you finished adding the feature to your app. Be sure to add, commit and push wherever your stopping point is. Submit your project to Canvas.

Be sure to use what you've learned about pair programming.

## Tips for the Observer

First, take a few minutes to have your partner walk through their project so you are familiar with the code and current functionality.

Decide, together, what feature you'll be adding.

Be on the lookout for:

- YAGNI
- DRY
- KISS

Assist by googling things and keeping the big picture in mind.

Ask for clarifications of the code you don't understand.

Help make design choices.

Ask about design choices your partner is making.

Provide constructive criticism that is actionable.

**GOOD**

- I think using `.map()` would work better than using `.forEach()` here because ...
- This code is hard to understand, I think better variable names would be ...
- Let's pause working on the CSS and go back to getting the form to work properly
- I think this should be two functions since this function does x and y, where it would be good to handle those tasks separately

**Bad**

- I don't like how you wrote this code (What don't you like about it? What can the driver do about it?)

## Tips for the Driver

Make sure you explain a lot and keep talking.

Remember, you are not your code. Be sure to be open to constructive criticism

## Rubric

Assess your partner on

- Ability to problem solve
  - Able to understand the problem that you (both) are trying to solve
  - Communicate how they are breaking it down
  - Explain possible solutions
- Demonstrate code quality
  - Was your partner making good design decisions as far as
    - Variable names?
    - Code organization? (in this case following RESTful routes, the file and folder naming conventions that you've been following in class?)
    - Code correctness? Was there any consideration of potential errors or problems with the initial solution? Were error handling/edge cases considered in designing a solution?
    - Choosing a good order of what functionality is being built and explain why (for example) the route would be built first, and then the database query (or vice versa)?
- Communication
  - Were you able to follow what your partner was doing?
  - Was your partner explaining what they were working on?
  - Were you given opportunities to participate/work as a team?
- Openness
  - Was your partner open to your suggestions?
  - Did your partner incorporate any of your ideas?
  - Did your partner accept any constructive criticism?
