# App Planning

## Introduction

In this program, so far, you've been building apps for yourself. The apps focus has been learning fundamentals. Now it's time to shift away from that focus and, instead, focus on applications that are for other people/customers and serve some business need.

To build applications that are for users, there is some upfront, non-coding work required.

Think about the apps you enjoy using they are probably

- Easy to navigate
- Make it easy for you to do what you want to do on them
- New features are intuitive/easy to discover/easy to learn to use
- Look nice
- Have a responsive design

## Building a User-First App

### User Stories

One of the first things you can do is to write `user stories`.

User stories are a way to write about one or more features of an app in plain English. They also help non-developer teams understand the features adn can help clarify whether a feature is needed, is the feature intended and how it should ultimately work.

User stories typically follow the following (or similar) format:

```
As a <type of user>, I want to <some goal>, so that <some reason>.
```

You can add detail by making the user stories smaller/more specific.

Let's look at a few examples:

- As a customer, I want to see my account balance, so that I know whether or not I need to transfer money.
- As a school administrator, I want to be able to add new students to a school, so that I can start enrolling them into classes.
- As a premium member, I want to be able to see articles without an overwhelming number of advertisements, so that I can focus on reading.

From the lens of the user, it is clear what you can do. From a developer's perspective, it is clear what kind of features need to be built, from a business perspective it is clear what this feature solves. User stories end up being a really clear and easy tool for cross-team discussions.

### Wireframes

Wireframes are a simple sketch of your app, usually done on paper or with an app. The wireframe lays out the different components and gives their approximate size and location.

The wireframes lets all stakeholders to agree on where the information will be placed before developers begin building the interface. If you have thought back to previous projects, if you just started building your app before planning, you may realize you don't like

Typically a UX/UI (user experience, user interface) designer would create these wireframes. However, your team will create them for your app for capstone.

Each page of your app should have a wireframe.
