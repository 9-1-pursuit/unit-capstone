# Presentation Preparation: Public Speaking

## Introduction

Public speaking is used to educate, entertain and influence. Building good public speaking skills will help you develop confidence, improve your communication skills and allow you to share your ideas in an effective manner that will help your professional growth.

Learning the skills to be able to deliver clear, precise, effective and succinct presentations is very challenging and is very difficult to teach. The way to learn to do this well is to continually practice.

Public speaking has many professional growth advantages like building confidence, developing better research skills, gaining stronger deductive skills and it allows people to advocate for causes.

## How to Get Better at Public Speaking

Many people don't like public speaking, in fact there are a lot of people who will say they even fear or dread it. A lot of the negative feelings about public speaking tend to stem from the anxiety that their presentation won't be good.

There are a lot of things that you can work on to ensure a good presentation.

### Coping with Anxiety

Public speaking tends to be a high stakes event. A lot of people may watch, decisions may be made based on a presentation, and the speaker tends to be deeply vested in the outcome.

These high stakes tend to make the speaker feel anxious. Anxiety is often perceived as a negative emotion to be pushed aside. But it doesn't have to be. Framing it as excitement and deep caring allows the speaker to use that energy to create the best presentation they can.

One of the best ways to help with the negative anxiety of public speaking is to prepare.

### Preparation

A great presentation can appear as a thorough and exceptional demonstration of a great project. However, this cleanly polished snapshot of the process tells very little about the chaotic mess that brought it about.

While it can seem like a great presentation must have come easy to the presenters, it is rarely the case. It takes a lot of effort and there are a lot of things to consider when putting together a presentation.

### Know Your Audience

The first thing to consider in preparation is who the audience is. Ultimately, you want to keep your audience engaged and interested in what you have to say and to do that, knowing what their background and goals of attending your presentation are will help shape the scope and tone of your presentation.

The audience may be very technical, in which case a technical presentation would be in order. However, if the audience is less technical, focusing on the things this non-technical audience cares about and, if needed, providing simple technical explanations (on the order of Explain it like I am 5), would be more suitable.

Simple and clear explanations that strive to inform and clarify things for the audience will demonstrate your understanding and communication skills better than a muddled explanation with a lot of buzzwords. Breaking down a tough concept into something that more people can understand takes time and practice. In working on this explanation, you will likely have to do some research and do a deeper exploration of what you want to discuss.

You audience may be people you know, in which case a more causal tone can be better. But if you have a lot of people you don't know, being more formal will go better. This consideration will help set the tone over your overall presentation.

Taking the time to clarify who your target audience is and how to best engage them will help elevate your presentation.

### Organization

Your presentation should have clear and coherent organization. As you move through the different aspects of your presentation you should have a reason to the order you are presenting things and good transitions. In essence, your presentation tells a story and it's important to be able to guide your audience through the story and do the work to make sure they don't get lost along the way.

Start by making a list of the major points that need to be made and make sure they all get addressed.

Drawing a flowchart, outline and/or checklist before building out a presentation can make everything come together better and faster.

### Components of a Presentation

Generally, a presentation is made up of

- An introduction of the presenter
- An introduction to the topic and overall agenda
- The main presentation
- Time for some questions and answers (Q&A)
- Thank you

### Slide Deck

Most presentations are expected to have a slide deck to accompany them or something else visual to demonstrate (e.g. a demonstration of an app).

Slide decks, in general, should have a cohesive color/font theme that suits the content. Things should be centered or aligned in a way that is neat and non-distracting.

If you are not a designer, keep things simple, choose a template that has been already been designed, and don't worry about adding any bells and whistles. If you are a designer, use the deck as another venue to show your skills.

Slides should be highly visual, have very limited text and be self-explanatory. There should be titles and labels for each slide. Each slide should be treated that if if fell out of your presentation deck and someone found it, they would be able to identify something meaningful about it:

- This is a title page of someone's slide deck giving a presentation next week...
- This is a graph that shows usage of something over time...
- These are four great reasons to do something...

The slides should not contain long blocks of text that the presenter would either read off of or ask the audience to read.

The content should feel cohesive and align with your outline.

If you are struggling to put your thoughts into words, consider if you understand what you are trying to say well enough. Fuzzy thinking leads to fuzzy writing. If needed, go back and research and study what you want to say more until you can say it clearly.

If you know what you want to say, but it is written in an awkward way that you can't figure out how to correct, reach out for help. A fresh set of eyes can help a lot.

Take the time to fix every single spelling and grammatical error.

### Practice

If you are relatively new to making presentations, make a full script of what you want to say. Practice it and edit it again and again along with your slide deck. When you practice, you should practice in a way that mimics the real presentation as best as you can. Immediately address your posture, tone, voice projection, speaking speed and timing of the presentation. For some people, it even helps to dress up for practice.

After a certain amount of practice, you should not need your script, but rather some cue cards/speaker notes. When you can deliver your presentation well with just some speaker notes, you are then ready to present. You shouldn't have to memorize your script, rather you should have become knowledgeable enough about your topic and your presentation that you can speak about it rather comfortably.

When you first start out, the amount of prep time for a presentation can be extremely long. With more practice and experience it will become a bit faster and easier.

### Effectiveness

People, generally, don't have long attention spans and can get easily distracted. However, a great presentation with a great lead-in will help them stay focused and interested in what you want to say.

You will likely be given a certain amount of time to present. That will help determine the level of detail of the presentation.

If the presentation is too short, look for feedback from peers, see what questions they have and then try to address them in your presentation. If a similar presentation has been made in the past, you can ask if there is a recording you can watch to get a better sense of what to talk about. You can also review the description of what you are being asked to present. Look for details that reinforce the main things you are trying to convey.

If the presentation is too long, first check for repetition. There should be no unintentional repetition. Try to restructure the presentation so that there is a straighter path to address all that is needed. Next, find ways to say what needs to be said more succinctly.

Make sure every sentence bullet point says something meaningful.

This bullet point informs the audience of nothing in particular:

- Apps are an important part of life

This bullet point conveys something meaningful:

- Our app is designed to help users spend up to 20% less time a week on x task by doing y

Your points should be self-sufficient. Your average audience member should not need to open their phone and start googling for definitions of words or acronyms in order to follow along with your presentation. Take the time to define or simplify things.

### Style/Presentation

Once you have a good grasp of your content, the next thing to tackle is the overall presentation.

A presentation is a performance and therefore you will need to be more mindful of your body language and voice during the presentation. You should have good posture, project your voice in a way like you are trying to talk to your friend who happens to be across the room. Make deliberate eye contact a few times throughout your presentation, and manage the speed of your words (when excited or anxious, most people tend to talk much too fast).

Just like other performances, practice is key to success. You can practice by yourself alone in a room, you can practice in front of a mirror, you can present to your friends/family/colleagues and ask for feedback and make a recording of yourself presenting - which you can go back and watch and review. While watching yourself speak can be awkward, it is usually one of the more informative ways of learning what you need to work on.

As you present, your nervous energy should shift into excited energy that you are willing to share with your audience.

Your appearance should be neat and in line with the dress code of the event. Wear things that are comfortable and that you feel confident in. It's important that you present yourself in a way that people remember you more than what you might have worn.

### Connecting with the Audience

Another important way to convey your information is to connect with your audience.

Start off by making a connection in your introduction. Typically, introductions ask you to share a little bit of information about yourself. Take the time to review your elevator pitch and adapt it for the presentation. Knowing a little bit about you, helps the audience find ways to connect to you and your presentation better.

Don't hide your personality. While there are so many different boxes to check to get a presentation right, there is always room to be yourself. Getting your message across in a genuine way helps keep your audience engaged.

Appearing confident will also help form a connection. It's ok if you don't feel confident during a presentation, this is definitely a time you can fake it until you make it. Things like speaking slowly and clearly, projecting your voice, and looking out at the audience can all help bring in the confidence you need to succeed.

### Presenting with Others

If you are doing a group presentation, make sure to practice each other. Be sure to clarify who is doing which part ahead of time.

Keep things positive and drama-free when presenting.

### Answering Questions

It is likely there will be time for Q&A (Questions and Answers).

Take a moment to check your posture and slightly smile and give a sense of calm openness.

When asked a question, it is typically good practice to repeat the question back (so that everyone in the room can hear it) and it can help you clarify if you understand the question. It also might buy you a little bit of time to put together your answer.

## No Questions

If you don't get any questions it might not be a bad thing. Sometimes you are presenting towards the end of an event and people are a little bit tired, but still paying attention to you. Sometimes there is a time crunch. Or, you might have shared a lot of information and people need a little bit more time with what you shared before forming a question. So don't panic if you don't get any questions. Just let the clock run down and gracefully wrap up.

## Bad Questions

Not everyone is great at asking questions. Just do your best to keep it positive, polite, and try not to get defensive.

People can ask questions that are very off topic, or well beyond the scope of what your presentation was about. Example: What are the legal consequences of someone using this app to do something illegal?

Some questions can sound rude (with or without intent to be rude). For example: "So why didn't you finish this part of the app?"

Some questions are oddly specific and addressing them don't benefit the audience at large. For example: "What if my grandmother was using this app and there was a lightning storm where the power went out..."

It's ok to quickly pivot and not try answer questions in any depth that don't fit or benefit the audience at large.

Ways to respond:

- This is beyond the scope of this presentation our goal was to demonstrate that this app does x
- There were time constraints that did not allow us to address this, our priority was to do x and y
- We are very interested in solving that issue in a future iteration
- I think that use case is very specific, let's meet after the presentation to discuss this in more depth, if you'd like

### Issues

There is something about presentations where there is a tendency for unexpected things to go wrong. Just as buttered toast tends to land butter side down, it just is this way, for everyone. Even if you practiced a hundred times flawlessly, it is very likely that something unexpected will happen during your actual presentation that never happened during your practice.

Aside from being well-rehearsed the next best thing you can do is stay cool under pressure. Figuring out how to work thorough whatever issue you are facing on your feet gracefully is an excellent sign of professional development.

### Summary

Presentations are a lot of work and can be quite intense however they tend to be rewarding experiences and are often cited as early career highlights.
