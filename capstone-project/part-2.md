# Capstone Part 2: App Planning

## Create User Stories (informal)

While talking through your app idea, write down your initial user stories that will drive your ability to create wireframes and ERDs. It is ok if these are rough ideas at this point in time.

## Create Wireframes

Choose to draw wireframes by hand or use a simple free app.

There should be one wireframe for every view of your app.

Focus on just creating wireframes for MVP.

Make sure the wireframes are accessible to everyone. Include a link on Trello for easy access.

## Create ERDs

Choose to draw ERDs by hand or use a simple free app.

Try to focus on MVP/keeping things simple.

Make sure the ERDs are accessible to everyone. INclude a link on Trello for easy access.

## Create and Set Up Trello Board

Create a Trello Board and add all the members.

Create user stories and put them all in the `backlog`.

## Get instructor approval

Show your assets that you've created to your instructor as a small presentation. Get and incorporate feedback from your instructor.

## Assign initial Tasks

Move a small number of user stories to the `to-do`. These should be the features your team can do in the span of 1 sprint.

Discuss and assign the cards to team members.

As you continue to plan and build, these cards will likely change.

## Create a Repository on Github

Create a repository and make sure everyone is added as a collaborator

Note: A number of these resources subitted via Canvas. They need to be far enough along that your team and instructional team feel confident that things are planned enough to start building the app. These resources will change over the duration of your project and that is OK.
