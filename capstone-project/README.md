# Capstone Project

## Project Requirements:

### Overview

Groups must demonstrate:

- Ability to collaborate with others and build functional code together
- Ability to create and use a database
- Ability to create and use a server
- Ability to create and use a UI (user interface)
- Ability to create an app that interacts with the UI, server and database
- Ability to deploy a project online

### Specifics

Project must contain:

- 2+ resources
- At least 1 one-to-many relationship
- Full CRUD routes (overall, not necessarily per resource)
- All members must contribute to the code base in a significant way

### Expectation

Use the technical stack you have learned. You may add additional libraries/APIs etc. Even if your app is designed to go to the App store, the apps on the app store all still have: A UI (user interface: something the user interacts with), a server and a database. Therefore, building a web app can still adequately demonstrate the core of your idea. If you would want to create a version for another device, you can work on that after demo day.
