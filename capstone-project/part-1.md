# Capstone Part 1: Team Building and Planning

This and upcoming planning sessions are for you and your team to help align on a shared vision and team dynamics that will guide you through your biggest and most challenging project yet.

## Succeeding at Group Work

Group work takes a lot of consideration, effort and planning in order to be truly successful.

Let's start with a list of qualities that successful teams have

- Shared vision and clear direction
- Trust and mutual respect
- Team-first mentality
- Diversity
- Open and clear communication
- Continuous learning
- Effective work practices

The goal for today will be to start building a team that has the above qualities

### Shared Vision and Clear Direction

Together, you will share your project ideas, give feedback and start putting together all of the planning your capstone needs in order to be successful.

### Trust and Mutual Respect

In order to build trust and mutual respect, you must spend some time getting to know each other. Being kind, open and actively listening helps begin to foster the kind of relationships that have trust and mutual respect. Practice kindness and active listening with your team daily.

Disagreement does not mean dislike or disrespect. Taking the time to talk through things and compromise will help your team work through some of its toughest challenges.

### Team-first Mentality

Though you may struggle to find things in common or things to talk about with your new group, all of you want the same outcome - a great capstone project. Remembering that that is the priority of your time together can help you focus and make effective decisions.

### Diversity

Everyone brings different experiences and skills into this project. Make sure to make space in your project for people to both lead with their strongest traits but also get opportunities to improve on the things they struggle with by collaborating.

### Clear and Open Communication

When you are empowered by trust and mutual respect, have a clear vision and are aligned on goals positive and candid conversations can happen and will help resolve and improve things as your project progresses.

### Continuous Learning

Stay open-minded, accept feedback and constructive criticism, apply what you are learning and be kind and thougthful as you give feedback to others

### Effective Work Practices

In the upcoming lessons we will go into greater depth about how to work effectively as a software engineering team.
