# Stand Up Guide

Stand ups should be short.

One person should lead the discussion, one person should be ready to update the trello cards (move cards, add more information, tag (will help someone) or remove people (will switch from code review to another task) etc. ), one person should be watching the time. 

Everyone should answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday?
- What am I working on today?
- Is there anything preventing me from moving forward on my work?

For debugging, larger conversations, or anything outside of the scope of these questions, set up a separate time to meet with the relevant members.
