# Stand Down Guide

The Stand Down should take place about once a week.

There will be three parts: Preparation, Retro, and Planning

The goal is to have open communication and be agile (adaptable) to wherever your team finds themselves at the time of these meetings.

Building a large app is challenging and there is a lot to still learn. Success is about learning and moving forward. 

Early in your career, it is extremely hard to guague how long it will take to build a feature. Make your best guess and learn from each guess. Even experienced devs can get the timing very wrong.

One of the goals of agile is to constantly adapt to the new things discovered along in the process when building a feature. Some common things that can happen are
- Certain gotchas with a feature that were not considered, making it much harder and more time consuming to build
- A library that was very easy to integrate and had a lot of the desired functionality that saved a lot of time on building a feature
- A library that ended up being a poor fit for the project 
- A decision to simplify a feature in order to make time for other functionality 

## Preparation

The day of this meeting, everyone should take a few minutes to update their Trello cards, review where they are in their work, and gain enough information from Trello to be ready to fully participate in the meeting. 

## Retro (Retrospective) - no more than half the time set aside

- Set the tone. Give everyone a moment to get into the right mindset. Take a couple minutes to ask everyone how they are doing/how their day is going. Make sure people have switched out of coding mode into being present for the meeting. 
- Set the roles: Someone leads the meeting, someone moves the Trello cards, someone watches the time (possibly takes extra notes, if needed)
- Gather information: Go over the Trello board, let everyone talk about how their week went
- Gain insights: What patterns does everyone see? Any surprises? What was learned? What is something new you didn't know before discussing things in this meeting?
- Make sure the relevant cards are moved to `done`
- If things are still in `to do` and never made it to `doing`, talk about it. Did the team decide to take on too much? Was there a problem that the whole team needed to stop and work on (like deployment)? 
- If things are still in `doing` and not quite done, make sure to clearly define what it would take to make them `done`

To make a successful retro, think of the following tips:
- Did everyone participate? Help ensure that everyone feels engaged in the process
- Does the meeting feel safe to discuss things openly and candidly? It's important that people feel that it is ok to open up about their struggles so that the team can collaborate on finding ways to support each other and keep moving the project forward. When a team member feels like they haven't been able to do as much as they thought they could, it can feel really bad. Support your teammate so that the next week can go better. A team that cannot talk candidly cannot problem solve effectively.
- Follow through - whatever you decide on, make sure you check-in about it and follow up

## Planning - half the time (or a little more)

Now that everyone knows how the week went, what was accomplished and where the struggles are, plan the next week.

Start with the big picture. Where are you in your process? How close are you to MVP? What are the critical features that need to be built? Make sure you all have alignment with the big picture.

Determine team velocity and capacity: Discuss what is realistic to get done before the next Stand Down meeting. 

Update the Trello cards. You should be able to move some cards to `done` (or have a clear idea of what needs to be doine to get them there) and some cards out of `backlog` into `doing`. 

If you were not able to move any cards that's ok! You are just beginning to learn about collaborative coding, building a big project, working with project management. If you have concerns about reaching MVP or overall progress, schedule a time with an instructor to help get some more guidance.
