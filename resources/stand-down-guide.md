# Stand Down Guide

The Stand Down should take place about once a week.

There will be three parts: Preparation, Retro, and Planning

The goal is to have open communication and be agile (adaptable) to wherever your team finds themselves at the time of these meetings.

Building a large app is challenging and there is a lot to still learn. Success is about learning and moving forward. 

Early in your career, it is extremely hard to gauge how long it will take to build a feature. Make your best guess and learn from each guess. Even experienced devs can get the timing very wrong.

One of the goals of agile is to constantly adapt to the new things discovered along in the process when building a feature. Some common things that can happen are
- Certain gotchas with a feature that were not considered, making it much harder and more time consuming to build
- A library that was very easy to integrate and had a lot of the desired functionality that saved a lot of time on building a feature
- A library that ended up being a poor fit for the project 
- A decision to simplify a feature in order to make time for other functionality 

## Preparation

The day of this meeting, everyone should take a few minutes to update their Trello cards, review where they are in their work, and gain enough information from Trello to be ready to fully participate in the meeting. 

## Meeting Best Practices

Be sure to run an effective meeting that stays within the topic and time boundaries set. Everyone should be engaged and feel that the meeting is productive and a good use of their time. 

- Start on time
- Stay on topic (have an agenda and stick to it, plan other meetings/other times to discuss things that were not planned)
- End on time. If you have something critical to discuss ask if it is ok to run over or if it is better to plan another meeting or meet with a smaller group of people. If you are always running over, figure out why and plan as a group how to solve it

## Retro (Retrospective) - no more than half the time set aside

- Set the tone.
  -  Give everyone a moment to get into the right mindset. Take a couple minutes to ask everyone how they are doing/how their day is going. Make sure people have switched out of coding mode into being present for the meeting. 
The following roles should rotate for capstone:
- Set the roles
  - One person should run the meeting (ask the questions, make sure everyone answers), make sure that the group stays on topic and after the meeting, sets up follow up meetings, as needed
  - One person should take notes
  - One person should update the Trello board
  - One person should watch the time and make sure the meeting does not run over
- Gather information (see below)
- Gain insights: What patterns does everyone see? Any surprises? What was learned? What is something new you didn't know before discussing things in this meeting? (see below)
- Update the Trello board and plan next teps

Things to cover:

- Accomplishments (~5 minutes)
  - Make sure the relevant cards are moved to `done` 
- The things that went well (~5 minutes)
- The things that didn't go well (~5 minutes)
- The things that can be done better (~10 minutes)
- Improving communication/adapting the use of Trello (~5 minutes)
  -  If things are still in `to do` and never made it to `doing`, talk about it. Did the team decide to take on too much? Was there a problem that the whole team needed to stop and work on (like deployment)? 
  - If things are still in `doing` and not quite done, make sure to clearly define what it would take to make them `done`
- What is everyone working on next, updating the Trello board (~10 minutes)


Further tips:

- Keep it positive/constructive
- Don't make it personal/don't take it personally
- Allow everyone to speak without interruptions
- Stay on topic

To make a successful retro, think of the following tips:
- Did everyone participate? Help ensure that everyone feels engaged in the process
- Does the meeting feel safe to discuss things openly and candidly? It's important that people feel that it is ok to open up about their struggles so that the team can collaborate on finding ways to support each other and keep moving the project forward. When a team member feels like they haven't been able to do as much as they thought they could, it can feel really bad. Support your teammate so that the next week can go better. A team that cannot talk candidly cannot problem solve effectively.
- Follow through - whatever you decide on, make sure you check-in about it and follow up

## Planning - half the time (or a little more)

Now that everyone knows how the week went, what was accomplished and where the struggles are, plan the next week.

Start with the big picture. Where are you in your process? How close are you to MVP? What are the critical features that need to be built? Make sure you all have alignment with the big picture.

Determine team velocity and capacity: Discuss what is realistic to get done before the next Stand Down meeting. 

Update the Trello cards. You should be able to move some cards to `done` (or have a clear idea of what needs to be doine to get them there) and some cards out of `backlog` into `doing`. 

If you were not able to move any cards that's ok! You are just beginning to learn about collaborative coding, building a big project, working with project management. If you have concerns about reaching MVP or overall progress, schedule a time with an instructor to help get some more guidance. 

Again, this should be a safe space to allow people to be honest about how it's going and to find constructive ways to make things better.
