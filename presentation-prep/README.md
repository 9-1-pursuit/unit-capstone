# Presentation Preparation

You will be presenting your app at Demo Day. Here are the specific details of this presentation.

## Getting Started

You will need to create the following resources and submit them for demo day so that the team running the event can compile everything and have it available for the event. 

- [Copy this demo script template]([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_X4-JCg2YglDaWIxCB2p_XRJLffN2XYp05Gq7Kxw1NE/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GfQLWbsKBKP5hN3tDrQu6d7l85Lq8xEzX9Te9vQoUtE/edit)), fill it out as you build out your presentation. 
    - Everything in orange should be updated to be specific to your app. 
    - Copy the transition and feature rows as many times needed. The number of features should also be increased/decreased to align with your presentation. 

  - [Here is an example of a completed script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_X4-JCg2YglDaWIxCB2p_XRJLffN2XYp05Gq7Kxw1NE/edit). Notice the level of detail in both the left and right columns.

  - [Copy this deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qXb3uDrNxSmzV5vTvHsLBptH0cKqL9Dy4QfyDILsFlM/edit#slide=id.g6c1b6be0e1_0_0). As described in the slide deck itself, you should work with your group to improve the design of the slide deck while keeping the general structure the same. 

## Timing

You will have approximately 8 minutes for your presentation:

- 1 minute for team introductions
- 7 minutes for your pitch and the app demo

There will also be 2 minutes reserved for your group to answer questions from panelists.

## Team Introductions

Each team member should have a personal pitch. This pitch should be specific, personalized and memorable. It should contain an element of a personal story.

Here are examples of stand out personal pitches from prior Demo Days:

- [Stephanie Ramirez](https://youtu.be/weOyHa_LY10?t=2710)
- [Jian Ting Li](https://youtu.be/weOyHa_LY10?t=3835)
- [Elizabeth Peraza](https://youtu.be/weOyHa_LY10?t=5070)

## App Introduction

Immediately start out by describing the context and problem. Explain the extent of the problem by discussing how big the problem or need is. If you have found any data that backs up your claim, be sure to share the specific numbers.

Next, give a brief overview of what the app does. Your audience should have an idea of what your app is about before you actually demonstrate it.

## App Walk-through

Your walk through should be carefully structured. Start with a user and walk through the user stories in your app. You should follow a particular customer persona and it should be consistent through your presentation.

Prior to presenting, make sure your app has the correct data loaded, if you have a user login, make sure you have the user created and the credentials are already saved/inputted.

If you will be creating any entries, be thoughtful about it, if there is an image URL, have the url handy, don't google mid-presentation to find what you want.

Make sure you are weighing the time you spend talking about different features in a proportionate way. The most important features that distinguish your app should have the most time dedicated to them.

Expected features like a drop-down menu, login, logout, responsive design, etc. should have minimal time dedicated to them. Even if you spent days or a week on a feature and are really proud of how you've grown technically, this presentation is geared towards demonstrating a business idea. You may get a chance to talk about your technical accomplishments during the Q&A.

## Future Steps

You likely did not build every feature you had hoped in the few weeks that you had. Also, as you built your app, you likely realized additional functionality that would be really great to have.

Make sure you reach a consensus with your team about what features you would work on next, if you were to continue building this app.

Be sure to provide context why these features are the most important ones to address first.

## Questions and Answers (Q&A)

Here are some common questions. Your app may not address some of these questions. That's OK, make sure you have an appropriate response that your team feels good about.

- How are you different from your competitors? (who are the competitors and what do you do differently?)
- How would you monetize this? (Freemium, ad-based, etc.)
- What was your biggest challenge as a team?
- What was your biggest technical achievement related to this app?
- Did you teach yourselves anything new to build this app? If so, what?
- Explain how your app handles a request and displays the results to the user
- Which API / library / framework do you use for feature X? Why did you use that API / library framework instead of a different one?
- Describe the infrastructure of your application. How much traffic can it handle and how could you change it to handle a lot more traffic?
- How is data persisted in your application? Explain your database schema and any trade offs you made.
- If you could have done one thing differently, what would it be?

### Additional Technical Questions

- What was your biggest technical achievement related to this app?
- Did you teach yourselves anything new to build this app?
- Technical decisions (why did you choose to do x over y)

### Additional Product Development Questions

- How would you envision finding users for this app?
- How would you propose marketing this app?
- How is this app different than other solutions on the market?
- What is your anticipated market size?

### Additional Teamwork and Learning Experience

- If you could have done one thing differently, what would it be?
- Do you plan on working on this app beyond tonight?
